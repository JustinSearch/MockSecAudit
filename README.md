As you can see, we have some EOL systems that may present a risk if not properly monitored. We'll come back to that later.

One glaringly obvious issue is our lack of "least privilege." Meaning people whose job functions do not require access to PII may still be able to access such information, creating a serious security and compliance risk.

<br />
As shown, we are not in compliance with any of the standards and lack even basic security controls, which puts us at high risk of being fined or experiencing a breach. These risks need to be mitigated immediately to avoid these outcomes.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Recomendation</h2>
To address gaps in compliance, Botium Toys needs to implement controls such as least
privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company also needs to properly
classify assets, to identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to
improve their security posture and better protect sensitive information.
